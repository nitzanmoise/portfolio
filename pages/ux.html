          <p>
            In the data collection assignment, we learned and practiced
            different ways to prepare an optimized user interface. Through these
            mathods we gattered information about the "target audiance" so we
            could make a firm faundation for a great user experiance.

          </h5>
          <p>
            The topic I chose for the desk research was the use of virtual
            reality in relation to elderly people with dementia. The idea of a
            desk research is to gather information from a collected data such as
            articles and media. Data collection allows the researcher to gain
            knowledge about a target audience/group and learn about recent
            trends and technology of the chosen topic.

          </h5>

          <p>
            By using the observation method, I was able to collect data on
            different live situations. The focus here was to learn how to
            observe a “target audience”, take notes and notice the change of
            behaviour in different situations.

          <p>
            Interview as a primary research method helped me understand the
            experience and the opinion of experts in the topic. I also learned
            how important it is to ask open and deep questions so I would gather
            an effective information.

          </h5>

          <p>
            Survey is a unique research method because it is easy to collect
            information from many people by asking them the same questions. From
            the survey results we could understand that information changes
            between different groups of people. We could divide people into
            groups by asking for age and gender.

            The presentation I made was informative and followed the task
            description, but I could improve it by adding further depth both in
            collecting and processing the information. I could ask more
            elaborative questions so I could understand better the answers.

          <p>
            The goal of the prototype assignment was to make an optimal user
            experience prototype in adobe XD with an UI kit and a fully content
            production for the target audience. We also made a conventions
            research on the aforementioned platforms regarding design, content,
            and functionality, chose a tone of voice that will fit our massage
            for the target audience - formal, professional, respectful, yet
            enthusiastic.

          <p>
            My part in the group project was to make a style tile, producing and
            documenting micro copy and copy examples. I also conducted the
            wire-flow of our prototype in an easy flowing way from a landing
            page to a job finding page with a search bar and a filter to
            minimize the search results.

          <p>
            At last we conducted a think aloud test to test our prototype and
            see how we can improve our user interface by the experience of our
            testers. We asked the testers to follow few steps in our prototype
            and say what they are seeing, and what they should do next. In the
            end of the test we asked some questions and we reviewed the answers
            from the transcription of the tests. We learned that our prototype
            was simple and easy to review, yet we could optimize our search bar
            filter to be more specific.

        <section>
          <h5>
            <span>Focus</span>
          </h5>

          <p>
            In the design sprint, it was the first time we had to work in a
            large group on an intense project. Our goal was to build in five
            days a native app prototype while each day had a different
            professional focus. The focus on each day was based of what we
            learned in the theme. We had to practice our skills and expand our
            knowledge in ux msthods such as: data collection, information
            architacture, content production, testing methods and more...

          <h5>
            <span>My part</span>
          </h5>

          <p>
            From the begnning of the sprint I was very dedicated to find a real
            problem that we could solve within our app concept. I came up with
            this problem - many new students in KEA find it difficult to
            socialize and make new friendships. After mapping and brainstorming
            different long-term goals I suggested a solution of an app where
            students would be able to create events and activities and invite
            their friends from school. Furthermore, I designed a concept map,
            and came up with some of the questions for the “experts”
            interviews”. I organized the story board from the chosen flow of our
            sketches, added more potential pages and functionality. I was a
            maker and as a part of the role I documented what we made so far and
            helped with the improvement of the prototype. In the pitch day I
            talked about the prototype itself and showed the flow of the app.

            <span>Achievements</span>
          </h5>

          <p>
            Through the sprint I learned the meaning of having different roles
            in a group and how important the roles are. When we didn’t work with
            the roles it was hard for us to agree and progress. On the fourth
            day of the sprint I decided to become a facilitator. I made sure
            that everyone know what to do and what is their role – who’s making
            the prototype and who’s writing the content. Through my role as a
            facilitator I gained understanding of how a group should function in
            a design sprint with specific roles and an up to date schedule.

            <span>Feedback</span>
          </h5>

          <p>
            The first major feedback point we got after our pitch was that even
            tough our app called “KEA Social” there is not enough details that
            connecting the platform to KEA, in the design and the layout. The
            second point was that we had a large "build-up" in our pitch for our
            platform but when we showed the prototype, we didn’t have enough
            time to show the whole flow and functionality.
