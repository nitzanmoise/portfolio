          <p>
            The goal of the project was to create a campaign website with a
            campaign video for “Food Sharing Copenhagen”. Even though the theme
            is basic content we had to use our skills we gained through the
            semester regarding design, user experience and layout. We chose to
            make an educational campaign to reflect people how important it is
            to reduce food waist and how big is the effect on the environment.
            On the website we had the video we made called “The leftovers” that
            follows through a journey of bananas to the consumers plate while
            sharing easy and simple tips that encourage the viewer to take the
            next step for reducing food waste. On the website we also have
            recipes examples of easy cooking dishes you can make out of “old”
            food.

          <p>
            It was very important for me to make an effective campaign and so as
            for my group. We brainstorm through a lot of ideas till eventually
            we decided to focus on a simple video with a strong message. I took
            a main part in filming, directing and editing the video. I also
            helped to refine the website and its content so eventually I added
            copywriting and made it responsive.

          <p>
            Through the process of the project I achieved many skills and
            competencies, for example: I Learned how to use adobe premiere in a
            professional way, I learned how to build a story in a dramaturgy
            frame work and translate it to specific scenes and then to a
            complete film.

          </h5>
          <p>
            To create a well-organized campaign film, we had to draw a
            storyboard so everyone in our group would be able to know what to
            expect before we start the production. We had to draw the different
            scenes with a small description and information about the angles,
            locations, props, sounds and composition.

          </h5>
          <p>
            Our storyboard got approved though we didn’t fill up the content
            section of each shot. We had a basic agreement of what we were
            supposed to shoot and what kind of locations and props we need. As
            for improvement we should have filled up the content section
            concerning all the things we needed to make a professional film
            production.

        <h2>05.02.04 “Customer pitch”</h2>

        <section>

          </h5>
          <p>
            At the end of the project we had to prepper a costume pitch for
            “Food Sharing Copenhagen” so we could present our main idea and
            values in a convincing way. We structured a three-parts pitch
            starting with “why” we do it. we motivate our listeners by presented
            a metaphor of the “ripple effect” that explain how small actions can
            make a major effect. Next, we explained “how” we encourage the
            viewer to take small steps to reduce food waist through our video.
            We presented some information and dramatic facts about the effect of
            food waist on the environment and how we could change it. Last we
            presented “what” we did. We showed our campaign website and its
            content and then we showed the video.

          <p>
            The costume pitch assignment taught me a lot about how to produce a
            meaningful and productive pitch. Through the process I gained skills
            of writing a convincing and motivating content directed to the
            target audience. I managed to talk in front of audience about the
            main ideas without having a written text with me.

          <h5>
            <span>Feedback</span>
          </h5>
          <p>
            Surprisingly the feedback we got from our teachers and the board of
            “Food Sharing” was very good. They told us that our pitch had a good
            flow and our message was powerful. One point we got, challenged our
            steps/tips claiming that it is not so easy for certain people to
            change their behaviour, for example: it won’t be easy for an
            unorganized person to make a weekly food plan.
