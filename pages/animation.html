          <p>
            The first assignment of the animation theme was "character animation
            on a background". The focus was on learning how to create a
            character in adobe illustrator from drawn sketches, filling up the
            character work sheet and give it psychological and sociological
            attributes. We Learned about animation principles and motion and
            eventually animated the character with a CSS sprite animation.

            <span>Achievements</span>
          </h5>
          <p>
            Through the process I learned how to use adobe illustration in an
            efficient and professional way by crating different layers for each
            part of the character, use the pen tool and the direct selection
            tool to draw different variety of shapes. I also learned how to
            create a flat background and what is the best visual way to position
            my character on the background. Even though I didn’t have much time
            to learn how to create sprite animation I managed to create a
            walk-Sycle of 8 different positions that made the animation look
            very alive.

          <h5>
            <span>Feedback and Improvments</span>
          </h5>
          <p>
            The positive Feedback I got was that I made the animation look very
            characteristic. On the other side, the width of the stroke of the
            character wasn’t consistent. The source of inspiration I chose was
            the cartoon tv show “Big Mouth”, I tried to create a unique “hormone
            monster” but it seems like my character was a bit too close to the
            source of Inspiration. To improve my character I will have to make
            the outline stroke in the same width and maybe change some of the
            colours. From the beginning I made my character look different than
            the original character e.g. skinny hip and legs, different hair and
            nose, and clothes.

            In this assignment we learned for the first time how to use Java
            Jscript in a webpage program. We had to make a user interface
            controlled by JS functions that turned on and of different CSS
            animations.

            Through the project I gained understanding and ability to write a
            logic JS code with variety of Boolean segments that allowed me to
            create a functional webpage. I learned how to connect my JS
            functions to the HTML of the webpage and how to manipulate CSS
            through JS.

            In project pool 1 and 2 we had to choose each day one project out of
            different projects. The idea was to get better in Java Script by
            practicing in building small projects with different functionality.
            We also used CSS and HTML to build a nice-looking project.

          </h5>
          <p>
            In project pool 1 we created a fortune-teller webpage that tells the
            user his fortune after he fills some input questions. To create a
            random fortune, I made a fortunes array that generated random
            fortune with the JS function math random. We made inputs validation
            that send an error message to the user if he is not filling all the
            inputs. I applied the validation in the fortune generator functions
            with “if” and “else” segment that checks the value of the input.
            <br />
            In project pool 2 we made an image slide show. We used a complicate
            CSS code that gets manipulate by JS function which activates each
            time the user presses one of the slide show arrows.

            and forums of code solutions we didn’t learn in class.

        <h2>04.04.01 Onboarding</h2>

          <p>
            The last project of the theme aimed to cover what we learned so far
            in the basic animation theme. We had to create an interactive
            onboarding for a target group with the use of gamification,
            illustrations and animation. Our main concern was that our target
            group - new international students in Denmark, will feel lonely and
            disconnected from the Danish culture after arriving to Denmark. The
            platform we made – “The Danish Experience”, was supposed to help the
            users to learn about the Danish culture by taking a trip around
            Copenhagen through different culture scenes with information about
            the Danish culture. After completing all levels, the user must
            answer a quiz so he will become a “Danish Expert”.

            <span>My Part</span>
          </h5>
          <p>
            At the beginning of the project we decided to divide the assignment
            between us, I got to write down the content of the onboarding from
            thinking about the micro copy text to make the quiz questions. After
            we had most of the illustrations, I collected the materials to a
            functional web code with JS functions that changed scenes and
            illustrations by adding and removing CSS classes.

            <span>Achievements</span>
          </h5>
          <p>
            In this assignment I was introduced for the first time to
            storytelling elements such as gamification and dramatological
            elements which I later used in our project for example: progress bar
            as a gamification element, positive sounds for completing the quiz
            and wining the game, and in contrast, sad sound when the user can’t
            complete the quiz. When we made the team canvas, we agreed to switch
            roles and try to be dynamic. Through the process of the project I
            felt like I had to do most of the coding job because I was the only
            one who felt comfortable of doing it. That made the work being not
            equally distributed and I didn’t get the chance to improve my skills
            in other aspects of the project. This case made me revaluate the
            importance of the team canvas and my role in a group project.

            We presented our project to the evaluation team in a public
            exhibition on the last day of the theme. We got positive feedback
            for the clear flow of the app and the visualization. We got some
            improvements tips as well, for example: filter the text so it won’t
            be to hard for the user too much - he will loose interest, show the
            user the quiz results after submitting the quiz or show him if he is
            right or wrong while he answers the questions, make shorter levels
            and shorter quiz to make a more easy user experience.
