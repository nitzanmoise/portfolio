        <h2>02.04.01 Responsive website</h2>

        <div class="sections-container">
          <section>
            <h5>
              <span>Focus</span>
            </h5>
            <p>
              In the theme basic web, we learned different design principles
              such as: Gestalt principles, contrast types, and colour theory.
              Our last and most important assignment was the "responsive
              website" which we made in order to practice what we learned in the
              theme and prove the skills we gained.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>
              <span>Design</span>
            </h5>
            <p>
              To create my website clear and organized I used some of the
              Gestalt principles in my design so it will be easy for the viewer
              to read, navigate and understand the different sections in the
              website. I also used colour contrast between the text and the
              background – white on black and black on white. I also used
              contrast between the size of the headlines and the reading text. I
              chose a complementary combination of colour grading from the
              colour wheel: brown and blue hues.

              <br /><br />
              Gestalt principles I used:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Proximity of headlines reading text and images that appear next
                to each other.
              </li>
              <li>
                Common region for text and headlines in a black background box.
              </li>
              <li>
                Similarity of menu items with the same colour and changed colour
                while hovering.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>
              <span>Content</span>
            </h5>

            <p>
              As part of learning how to produce content for the website I made
              a desk research about the Dada movement and art style, I collected
              different articles from the internet about the artists and the art
              pieces. I also collected images in different sizes. I picked the
              most important and interesting content for the website and divided
              the articles to sections: Heading and intro text with the main
              message of the Dada movement, sub headline with background and sub
              headlines with more details about the artists and the art pieces.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h5>
              <span>Programming and Layout</span>
            </h5>

            <p>
              The website was build with HTML as the skeleton of the website and
              CSS as the stylesheet. I used an overall grid on the body and
              flex-box for articles and sections. In order to make the website
              responsive I defined three media queries break points starts with
              mobile first for small screens, then tablet and medium screens and
              last, desk-top version and larger screens. The layout of the
              website is symmetrical and “Mostly Fluid” so it changes in
              different break points for example: The main content turns from a
              row layout in medium and large screens to a column layout in small
              screens. The white space gets smaller in medium and small screens
              break points. The images and the text are also getting smaller in
              a fully responsive way because they are set in a percentage
              measurements than in pixels.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>

              </span>
            </h5>
            <p>
              After compliting the assignment, I gained different skills. I
              learned how to program with HTML:5 and CSS3 and how to design
              difrrent layouts with flexbox, grid and layout principles such as:
              alignment, golden section, symmetry/asymmetry. I learned how to
              make a productive desk research by collecting articles, image
              assets and more. I learned how to use photoshop by creating a
              moodboard of a given art style and illustrator by designing logo
              and icons.
